        <div class="content">
            <p>
                <span class="bold">The highly debated topic of iguana diets.</span> With the increased popularity of pet iguanas and the fact that
                there is still much to be learned about them, diets as well as many other aspects will constantly be debated
                and discussed. Instead of providing a specific diet or listings of foods that must be fed, the Green Iguana
                Society would like to provide listings of foods that may be fed, foods that have been known to be dangerous,
                and leave it up to the iguana owner to decide which foods should be fed. We realize every iguana is different
                and every iguana owner is just as different, so instead of continuing a debate on diets, we would like to
                state that these are only our recommendations of foods that can be chosen as a part of a complete and healthy
                diet. Basically, we want to provide as many facts that are known about certain foods and methods, and hope
                that each person will plan their own iguana diet based on the information we provide.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold"> Iguanas are strict herbivores.</span>Although many iguana care books and a few people still recommend iguanas
                be fed insects and other animal protein based foods, the Green Iguana Society would like to stress that iguanas
                are strict herbivores (plant eating only). The myth that iguanas in the wild have been seen eating insects
                can be explained in a number of ways, but the fact is that they usually only eat insects in the wild by accident
                along with a piece of vegetable matter or by necessity when no other foods are available. Since iguana owners
                have complete control of their pet's diet, the Green Iguana Society recommends that insects and other foods
                containing animal protein should be avoided as much as possible, if not completely.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">How iguanas eat and drink. </span>Iguanas have many small teeth which they rip and tear their food with, instead
                of chewing it. Usually, they will take large bites and swallow their food whole and occassionally they will
                just tongue-flick their food into their mouths. When they drink water, which is usually only occasionally,
                they will dip a large portion of their head into the water, lapping up the water under the surface or sometimes
                they may even lick water droplets off of plants and other misted surfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold"> How often should an iguana be fed?</span> Feeding an iguana daily is recommended. Many books and people recommend
                feeding an adult iguana every other day or every few days, but the Green Iguana Society definitely recommends
                that all iguanas should be fed every single day. One meal, two meals, three meals or more is fine, just as
                long as itâ€™s every single day and that the iguana is being fed enough to stay healthy.
