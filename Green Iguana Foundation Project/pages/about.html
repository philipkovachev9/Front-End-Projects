        <section>
<p>
 The Green Iguana Foundation was founded in August 2010 in Fort Worth, Texas, as a non-profit organization. The IF aims to
raise funds for conservating green iguanas habitats, and to raise awareness about proper keeping in captivity by providing
all the right information needed for their care. Since iguana ownership requires a lot of research, we decided to help people
by providing articles with clear information about their care. It is our hope that the society will contribute toward a major
improvement in iguana care and a greater understanding of the issues involved with owning a Giant Green Iguana. Since its
establishment in 2010, the Green Iguana Foundation has grown by leaps and bounds.
