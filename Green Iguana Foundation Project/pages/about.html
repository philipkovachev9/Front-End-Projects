                    The Green Iguana Foundation was founded in August 2010 in Austin, Texas, as a non-profit organization. The IF aims to raise
                    funds for conservating green iguanas habitats, and to raise awareness about proper keeping in captivity
                    by providing all the right information needed for their care. Since iguana ownership requires a lot of
                    research, we decided to help people by providing articles with clear information about their care. It
                    is our hope that the society will contribute toward a major improvement in iguana care and a greater
                    understanding of the issues involved with owning a Giant Green Iguana. Since its establishment in 2010,
                    the Green Iguana Foundation has grown by leaps and bounds.
