        <h1>Lighting and Temperature</h1>
        <section>
            <p>
                Green iguanas need lots of heat. With a baby green iguana, one heat bulb is sufficient, but with an adult green iguana, you
                need a bank of at least six lights in order for the green iguana to adequately heat up its entire body. I
                suggest using incandescent heat bulbs and a double row of fluorescent UV bulbs so that vitamin D synthesis
                is possible. UVA and UVB should both be provided for optimum results. Strong UV fluorescent lights are needed
                to prevent metabolic bone disease. A hotspot of at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit should be provided. Additionally,
                the heat should come from above the green iguana, so the parietal eye is engaged, thus enabling the green
                iguana to thermoregulate as required. Located directly on top of the head of green iguanas, behind their
                eyes, is an unusual scalelike organ called a parietal eye or pineal body. This scalelike sensory organ can
                detect light, dark and movement. The parietal eye is extremely important for thermoregulation purposes and
                to warn green iguanas of predators approaching from above, such as birds of prey. Of course, parts of the
                cage should be cooler, so the green iguana is able to choose the temperature it likes by thermoregulating
                between hotter and cooler temperatures. A high end of 120 degrees and a cooler end in the low to mid 80s
                works well with green iguanas. The real key is allowing the green iguana to choose its own body temperature,
                and all the keeper has to do is provide the means for it to do so. DO NOT USE HOT ROCKS, HEAT PADS OR ANY
                OTHER HEAT SOURCE COMING FROM THE FLOOR. Captive green iguanas often burn themselves when substrate heaters
                such as "hot rocks" are used as a heat source. The reason for this is that the parietal eye is not engaged,
                and green iguanas do not recognize these as heat and attempt to bask. The iguanasâ€™ legs and stomach are usually
                burned because they do not realize how hot they are getting. I have seen second- and third-degree burns serious
                enough to cause death from using a hot rock as a heat source. Remember these two things very well: provide
                the adequate size and the adequate temperature.

                <h2>Humidity</h2>
                Green iguanas come from humid environments where the moisture in the air is natural and constant. In captivity it is our
                responsibility to meet the iguanas needs and provide them with a similar habitat. This means that we should
                be trying to maintain their humidity level at or around 70% - 80% and we should not allow it to fall below
                65%. Many iguana owners believe that the humidity needs to be so high that moisture is present. This is not
                only inaccurate but it can facilitate bacteria and fungal growth. If moisture is present on the walls or
                glass of the enclosure for extended periods of time there is a good chance that your enclosure isn't properly
                vented. Adequate air flow is crucial to proper housing and to prevent standing water/condensation. There
                are a few ways in which to raise humidity in your iguanas enclosure. Some of them are pretty simple and others
                will require a small monetary investment. Regardless as to what method or collection of methods you use,
                something needs to be done to keep the humidity in the acceptable range.
