# Front-End-Projects
Here I store my Front-End development projects.

## Green Iguana Project
A website built for a fictional non-profit organization that aims to save the green iguana lizards by providing educational information and raising funds.

## Memory Game
A quick memory game created by using ES6 syntax.

## Repti Care
An app designed to help organize information about exotic animals. It can be used to add information about an owned animal which gets saved to Firebase database and the posted information can later be retrieved. Bootstrap is used for styling.

## Todo List
A simple Todo list that I have created. User can add a new todo and delete it. Items can be added with a button or by pressing the enter key.
